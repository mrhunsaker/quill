"""Quillins manifest model, capability catalogue, and error hierarchy.

This module is the wx-free, dependency-free heart of the Quillins framework. It
defines the immutable data model for a ``quill.extension/1`` manifest (the same
contract documented in ``docs/quillins.md`` §13), the catalogue of capabilities
an extension may request, the host API version, and the typed errors an author
or the host may encounter.

Nothing here performs validation, IO, or code execution; see
:mod:`quill.core.quillins.validation` and :mod:`quill.core.quillins.loader`.
